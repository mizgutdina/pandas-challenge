Note for the grader: I have included screenshots of my code and outputs in proper formatting in Jupyter Notebook because formatting on GitHub file preview does not look right for some reason.

Data Analysis: Description of three observable trends based on the data.

1)	Gender Demographics analysis showed that male players constitute the majority (84%) of customers of our gaming company. It can be inferred that males are more likely to purchase optional items that enhance playing experience than female/other genders. This point is further strengthened by the Purchasing Analysis as it demonstrates that males completed far more purchases (652 out of 780) which accounted for the largest share of our revenue ($1,967 out of $2,380).

2)	Based on Age Demographics analysis, majority of our players, almost 45%, are between 20-24 years old. This age group was also the highest spender, when compared to other age groups, as it brought almost $1,115 in revenue.

3)	 Finally, two of our most popular items were also our most profitable ones. “Final Critic” and “Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm”, with 13 and 12 total purchases respectively, were the most shopped for and brought in approximately $60 and $50 in total revenues each.
